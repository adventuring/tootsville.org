The response will contain the WebRTC session initiation data you need to
join  the  Gossipnet. Attempt  to  connect;  if  it  fails, try  to  PUT
a fresh request.

@subsection{Status: 204 It's always dark in the beginning}

This shouldn't be  returned; it means that there are  zero known players
in the universe.
