This chapter enumerates the client-side Javascript components of
Tootsville.

This front-end is broken down into a number of modules, each of which
is in its own namespace; often, a namespace is defined entirely by one
source file, but not always.

Entries in this section are in the order in which they are defined in
the source code, rather than alphabetically.
