<h1> 504 Gateway Timeout (Service Worker not responding) </h1>

<p> The web server process that should handle your request did not reply for
  a very long time.  This usually means that the system is too busy serving
  other users' requests.  </p>

<p> The  collection of  back-end workers that  should have  handled your
  request was <tt><!--#echo var="HTTP_HOST"--></tt>. </p>

<!--#if expr="%{HTTP_HOST} =~ /test.tootsville/" -->

 <p> Those are testing servers.  It's possible that a software experiment is
being tested right now that has caused a disruption.  </p>

<!--#elif expr="%{HTTP_HOST} =~ /qa.tootsville/" -->

 <p> Those are QA (Quality Assurance testing) servers.  It's possible that a
software experiment is being tested right now that has caused a disruption. 
</p>

<!--#else-->
<p> <q>Tootsville.org</q> are our main servers. Unfortunately, a disruption
  like this will probably affect many or most of our players. We'll attempt to
  restore service quickly; check <a
