      <p> Your  parent or guardian must  give you permission to  play in
        Tootsville. Once they approve, you'll be able to play. Ask their
        permission now! </p>

      <h3> Parents: </h3>
      <p> Right now this is not finished software. </p>
      <p> To allow your child to play, go <em>on your computer or device</em>
        to <b>play.Tootsville.org</b> and sign in. </p>
      <p> Then you can approve or deny their request. Requests are good for one hour. </p>
