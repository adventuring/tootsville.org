Gossipnet protocol API

Every packet begins with a command key,  which is one of =_cmd=, =c=, or
=from=.  =_cmd=  is  used  exclusively  for  the  =logOK=  message,  for
historical reasons. To  choose between the =c= and  =from= command keys,
in  the JavaScript  API, prefix  =from= commands  with a  =:= character.
For example, =:command= will be sent as =from: "command"= , but =command=
will be sent as =c: "command"=.

Infinity mode protocol is defined on the server side better.
